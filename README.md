# dotfiles

## Purpose

This repository was inspired by [chris@machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTLYiNvRIVI&t=1543s). I have been working in the Software Engineering industries for 10+ years and finally felt like I need to optimize my development workflow. 


## Why Use Dotfiles?

Your dotfiles are personal to you.

You spend a sufficient amount of time fine-tuning your setup. You curate configurations and settings that best suit your workflow, aesthetic, and preferences. And you end up with a development environment that helps you, personally, be more productive.

What if after all that time you spent, you now have to switch to a new, different machine? Does that mean you have to start all over again from the beginning?

How would you remember the exact settings and commands you used?

Or what if you have a second machine and you want your set up to be exactly the same on both systems?

One of the main goals of developers is to automate repetitive tasks.

Creating a dotfile repository that is source-controlled and hosted on GitHub will save you time when you want to set up a new computer and install the exact same settings you created for your previous one.

That way all your settings and preferences can be reusable and consistent on other machines.
